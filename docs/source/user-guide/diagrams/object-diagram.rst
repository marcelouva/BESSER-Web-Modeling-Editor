Object Diagrams
===============

Object diagrams provide a visual representation of object instances based on the class diagrams in BESSER. They show how specific objects interact, their attribute values, and how associations between them are instantiated.

Palette
-------

The palette includes elements for creating object diagrams. You can drag and drop **Objects** and model instance-level relationships (links). All elements are tied to the class definitions from your class diagram (or structural model).

Getting Started
---------------

Objects
~~~~~~~

To add an object:

1.  Drag and drop an object element from the left panel onto the canvas.
2.  Double-click the object shape to edit its properties.

  :alt: Object properties
  :align: center

*   **Name**: Unique name for the object instance.
*   **Class**: The class this object instantiates (must exist in your class diagram).
*   **Attribute Values**: The specific values for this instance.

Object Links
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create links between objects:

1.  Click the source object.
2.  Drag from a blue connection point to the target object.

  :width: 370
  :alt: Object link
  :align: center

Double-click the link to:

*   Modify the **link name**.
*   Choose the **Association** this link instantiates.

OCL Constraint Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you run **Quality Check → Syntactic Check**, the editor validates the
object diagram against OCL constraints defined in the structural model. This
allows you to verify invariants, pre-conditions, and post-conditions on real
data examples.

.. note::

  **Semantic Consistency Check** is available for **Class Diagrams** only.
  For object diagrams, use **Syntactic Check**.
