Using the Web Modeling Editor
=============================

This guide explains how to use the BESSER Web Modeling Editor.

Accessing the Editor
----------------------

You can access the BESSER Web Modeling Editor in two ways:

1. Public online version: Visit `editor.besser-pearl.org <https://editor.besser-pearl.org>`_ in your web browser
2. Local deployment: Deploy the editor locally by following the instructions in :doc:`./deploy_locally`

Dashboard Structure
-------------------

.. note::
   The BESSER Web Modeling Editor is organized around **projects**. Projects allow you to group related diagrams together, manage multiple models within a single workspace, and maintain better organization of your work. A project can contain multiple diagrams of each type.

The numbered elements in the interface are described below.

1. File Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *File* menu provides project and diagram management:

- *New / Open / Import Project*: Opens the project hub where you can create a new project, open a recent one, or import an existing project. Supported diagram types: Structural (class diagrams), Object, State Machine, Agent, Neural Network, GUI No-Code, and Quantum Circuit. A project can contain multiple diagrams of each type.
- *Load Template*: Import a model template in JSON or B-UML format (``.json`` or ``.py`` file).
- *Export Project*: Export your project or individual diagrams in B-UML, JSON, SVG, PNG, or PDF format.
- *Import Class Diagram from Image*: Use AI (OpenAI) to convert an image of a class diagram into a model.
- *Import Class Diagram from KG*: Import a class diagram from a knowledge graph file (TTL/RDF/JSON).
- *Preview Project*: Preview the current project layout.

2. Generate Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once your model is complete, use the *Generate* menu to produce code using the
`BESSER code generators <https://besser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generators.html>`_.
Select a generator from the dropdown and the output will be downloaded to your machine.

3. Deploy Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *Deploy* menu lets you publish your generated application:

- **Connect GitHub to Deploy**: Sign in with GitHub (appears when not yet authenticated).
- **Publish Web App to Render**: Deploy the generated web application to
  `Render <https://render.com>`_ for cloud hosting. Requires a connected GitHub account.

4. Community Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *Community* menu connects you with the BESSER community:

- **Contribute**: Opens the BESSER contribution guide on GitHub.
- **GitHub Repository**: Opens the BESSER GitHub repository.
- **Send Feedback**: Opens a feedback dialog to share your experience with the team.
- **User Evaluation Survey**: Opens an evaluation survey to help improve the editor.
- **Report a Problem**: Opens the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs.

5. Help Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *Help* menu provides guidance and information:

- **How does this editor work?**: Overview of the editor's features.
- **Start Tutorial**: Launches an interactive walkthrough of the editor.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Displays available keyboard shortcuts.
- **About BESSER**: Information about the BESSER project.

6. Quality Check
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click the **Quality Check** button to run one of two validation modes:

- **Syntactic Check**: validates model construction and metamodel rules, and
  checks OCL-related constraints when applicable to the active diagram type.
- **Semantic Consistency Check**: available for **Class Diagrams**. This mode
  translates the model to Alloy and runs a SAT check to determine whether at
  least one valid instance exists.

Result interpretation:

- **Syntactic Check** returns validation status with detailed errors/warnings.
- **Semantic Consistency Check** returns ``sat = true`` (consistent),
  ``sat = false`` (inconsistent), or ``sat = null`` when consistency cannot be
  determined.

7. GitHub and Utilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The right side of the top bar provides quick-access utilities:

- **Theme toggle**: Switch between light and dark mode.
- **Star**: Star or unstar the BESSER GitHub repository (when signed in).
- **GitHub account**: Sign in or out of your GitHub account. Once authenticated,
  the Deploy menu becomes available.
- **Sync**: Synchronize your project with GitHub version control.

8. Left Sidebar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The left sidebar provides navigation and diagram management:

- **Diagram type tabs**: Switch between diagram types (Class, Object, State Machine, Agent, GUI, Quantum Circuit). Each tab shows the diagrams of that type in the current project.
- **Diagram tabs**: Within each type, tabs at the top (e.g., "Library Complete") let you switch between multiple diagrams. The **+** button creates a new diagram of that type.
- **Icon shortcuts**: Quick access to project settings, layers, and other tools.

9. Palette
~~~~~~~~~~

The palette contains the shapes and elements you can drag and drop onto the canvas. The available elements change depending on the active diagram type. For class diagrams, the palette includes:

- **Class** (with attributes only)
- **Class** (with attributes and methods)
- **Abstract Class**
- **Interface**
- **Enumeration**
- **OCL Constraint**

Other elements like Associations, Generalizations, and Association Classes are created by connecting elements directly on the canvas.

10. Canvas
~~~~~~~~~~

The canvas is the main drawing area where you design your model. You can:

- Drag elements from the palette onto the canvas.
- Connect elements by clicking and dragging from connection points.
- Double-click elements to edit their properties.
- Pan and zoom to navigate large diagrams.

11. Agent Widget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Agent Widget** (bottom-right corner) provides an AI-powered assistant that can help you with modeling tasks. Click the bot icon to open the chat interface and ask questions about your model or get suggestions.
